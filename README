PREVIEW NOTES

This 0.10.1 release of LuaSrcDiet has the same functionality as the old
Lua 5.0.2 version, except for the missing verification of the output
file feature by way of comparing the token stream. It is more flexible
in the way in which optimization options can be enabled or disabled.

For samples, see the sample/ directory. Performance statistics can be
found in the sample/statistics.txt file.

Planned near term work:
(a) seminfo optimizations: string, number, comments
(b) automatic tests for lexer optimizations
(c) lexer output comparison for output verification
(d) integrate Yueliang's parser skeleton
(e) local variable name optimization using the parser
