PREVIEW NOTES

The 0.10.1 release of LuaSrcDiet has the same functionality as the old
Lua 5.0.2 version, except for the missing verification of the output
file feature by way of comparing the token stream. It is more flexible
in the way in which optimization options can be enabled or disabled.

Release version 0.10.2 has aggressive optimizations for string and
number tokens.

For samples, see the sample/ directory. Performance statistics can be
found in the sample/statistics.txt file. Preliminary test samples for
strings and numbers can also be found in the sample/ directory.

Planned near term work:
(b) automatic tests for lexer optimizations -- 0.10.3 RELEASE HERE
(c) lexer output comparison for output verification -- 0.10.4 RELEASE?
(d) integrate Yueliang's parser skeleton (ONGOING)
(e) local variable name optimization using the parser -- 0.11.0 RELEASE HERE
(f) paranoid checking, after (c)

BEHAVIOUR NOTES

* embedded line endings in strings and long strings always
  normalized to LF
* will not optimize trailing spaces in long strings, only warns
* scientific notation generated in number optimzation is not in
  canonical form, this may or may not be a bad thing, so feedback
  is welcome

POSSIBLE TODOS

* convert long strings to normal strings, vice versa
